% NUMARICAL ANALYSIS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING %
%################################################################
%
% Numarical analysis have a great role in almost every field of science but
% in computer science it also have a great role in computer science there
% are number of phenomna present it is impossible to list them all but here
% we will cover the most basic and common things in computer science
% because of numarical analysis here we have some concepts in computer
% science:
% 1. In computer science we start a algorithm and it end up in most
%    suitable optimal solution like converging point after that there is no
%    efect on quantity but time can be go up to infinity so here by numarical
%    analysis we get a optimal solution.
% 2. we can learn machine learning algorithms just by a subset of domain by
%    wich we can estimate the solution all because of numarical analysis.
% 3. we can produce simulations just by the use of approximation.
% 4. we can make smart system that will predict the user's point of view by
%    numarical analysis.
% 5. After all this discussion there is a thing which is the most
%    beneficial thing in numarical analysis , yes the thinking capacity and
%    capability it have changed the way of thinking of programmer he starts
%    thinking in every point of condition the boundry conditions and the
%    termination condition very optimally in every algorithm.
